*Actually, this game was made as a high school project for a programming class. The codebase is not very good and should not be used as a good example! But it is really fun to play for a while and people really liked it.*

## What about backend?
If you tried to play this game, you found out it has a leaderboard, currency rates etc. The back-end is made in `Lumen framework`, but it is not available on `GitHub`. (but, if you really want to look at it, feel free to send me a message).
