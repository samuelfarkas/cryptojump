# Be careful!
Actually this game was made as high school project for programming class. 
Codebase is not very good and should not be used as good example!
But it is really fun to play for a while and people really liked it.

# What about backend?
If you tried to play this game, you found out it has leaderboard, currency rates etc.
Back-end is made in Lumen framework, but it is not available on github (but, if you really want to look at it, feel free to send me a message).
